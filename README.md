An example of augmented reality with the Vuforia SDK and Unity 5.5. I used Blender to upload a 3D model and then uploaded the blender file to Unity. With Vuforia, I was able to create a target from a JPG image, in this case it was an page from a catalog. Once I had both the target and model, I configured the Vuforia settings in Unity to present what you see below. The camera detects the target and will then display the 3D model.
